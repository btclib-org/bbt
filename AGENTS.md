# Repository instructions

Follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for issues, pull requests,
and local gates. Read
[REPOSITORY.md](./REPOSITORY.md) before changing workflows or repository
settings.

When an agent works here, a separate worktree per task keeps your own
checkout clean: hooks and agents change files where they run. For
example, `git worktree add ../<name> origin/main -b <branch>`, and
`git worktree remove ../<name>` when done.

Choose the least capable model that can reliably complete the task: use a fast
model for straightforward execution, a reasoning-focused model for multi-step
work, and the most capable available model for difficult or ambiguous problems.
Increase capability if progress stalls.

This repository is course material, read or cloned rather than released.
`py-scripts/` holds demonstrations, `ipynb/` holds notebooks with committed
outputs, and `excel/generate.py` generates the spreadsheets. Read the
repository-specific section of REVIEWING.md before changing those materials.

## Code Review Rules

Review against [REVIEWING.md](./REVIEWING.md). Its *The verdict* says
which review opens with a verdict line and what every other review
posts.

The heading is the one Codex's GitHub review asks for
([Customize what Codex reviews](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/third-party/github#customize-what-codex-reviews)).
